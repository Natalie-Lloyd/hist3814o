Final Project notes and faillog.

I am analyzing the articles written about the Pontiac Pride Jamboree, which ran for 8 years starting in 1990. 
I will report on Names (family names), places mentioned, dates on which the Jamboree took place, the location, 
the artists preforming, the extracurricular activities (workshops), relationships, committies, and official members 
of the community (council members), along with attendance numbers and amount of funds raised. 
In the 1995 archive of the paper, the text ink is smudged and faded in much of the paper and it is difficult to 
read it properly. 
I realized that I could read the txt. version, which I am doing now, althought it is more difficult to follow because of 
the odd line breaks and hypertext. 

I have written all the text for the Timeline slides, and now I will begin to work on the look and feel of them.

I also decided to create a word cloud (cirrus) for each year to see what words, names, etc. are most frequent. 
I stuggled a little to find a tool in voyant that really embodied what I was trying to do and because I am a visual person, I kept
comming back to the word cloud tool, even though it may have not been the best option looking back. (but it did do the job).
