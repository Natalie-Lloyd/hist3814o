Module 4: For this module we can choose 2 exercises that relate to our final project.

Exercise 6:

August 2:

The link provided in the exercise notes that I am to paste into Voyant is not working. 
I got an error message saying "failed attempt to create a corpus".

I will check on Slack space to see if others had the same problem and if there's a solution.

August 3:

I checked on Slack space and prof. Graham provided a new link. 
I copied all the text that was in the link and pasted it into Voyant. 
This is not my preferred method because the paragraph is very very large but it does seem like Voyant is capable of processing
it anyways. I have used voyant before for analyzing song lyrics, but that was not very much text.

I am having a hard time figuring out what Rezoviz is in Voyant. 
Is this a seperate page in voyant? or should I be able to access it from the page which my results appear on? 
I don't see the gear (cogwheel) symbol. I annotated the instructions and also asked in the slack space where to find it.
